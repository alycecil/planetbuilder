# Alice's Planetary Construction

I have long wondered why I a interstellar empire able to build ringworlds and other equally gargantuan living structures to why I cant just build a shell world in orbit around other worlds.

The goal is to add decisions that invoke the script like the effect ready command as follows:
```
solar_system = { spawn_planet = { class = pc_asteroid location = prev has_ring = no init_effect = { set_name = "ASTEROID" set_planet_flag = new_asteroid set_planet_flag = new_asteroid_unnamed } } }
```
